# This is a place for random notes!

# Modules I know about: math.py, random.py

# a % 2 == 1 'then the number must be odd!'
# a % 2 == 0 'then the number must be even!'

# To copy a list and make the copy in an entirely new memory slot use the following format
# list = [1, 2, 3]
# list_2 = list[:]

# When using the 'or' operator remember that both sides of the operator need to have complete statements! 
# ex if variable == value or variable != notValue < this will work
# ex if variable == value or notValue < this will not work
# If you give the statment a lone character like a single letter it will always be read as true!

# In the terminal typing 'cls" will clear the screen!

# Ternary operator example:
def monkeytrouble(a_smile, b_smile, c_smile):
    return True if a_smile == b_smile else False
